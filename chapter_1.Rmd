## Exercise 1.1: get to know your audience

This exercise presents a specific HR based scenario where you are a data analyst and asks for three ways you could get to know your audience (a new head of HR) better.

I would try the following:

-   Speaking to colleagues who have already met the new head of HR.

-   Reading any publicly available reports, blogs etc. the new head of HR has written.

-   Scheduling a meeting with the new head of HR.

I would focus on trying to address the following questions:

-   What does the new head of HR perceive to be the major challenges facing the organization?

-   What are the professional interests of the new head of HR and what is their background? Has their career taken them from specialist in a specific area to a more generalist role?

-   Why has this specific person been hired for the role of head of HR? Why now? What are the organizational drivers for needing some one with their specific skill-set, vision and approach.

## Exercise 1.2: narrow your audience

This exercise presents another scenario, this time you work as an analyst for a national retailer. This time focus on understanding the audience for findings of a survey of shoppers who have bought 'back-to-school' products.

**Question 1:** Potential audiences who could be interested in the survey data include:

-   Within the organisation:

    -   Various head office departments/functions (marketing, finance, purchasing ...).

    -   People working within retail stores.

-   Beyond the organisation:

    -   Audiences similar to those identified above (within the organisation) but at competitors.

    -   Trade journals/press.

    -   Policy-makers in areas that intersect with schools (education, transport, sport ...).

    -   Teachers and other educational providers.

**Question 2:** Potential audiences who would care about the findings of the survey results:

-   Core strategic functions within the organisation - strategy, marketing and finance.

-   Management teams within the organisation's stores

-   Core strategic functions within competitor organisation - strategy, marketing and finance.

**Question 3:** Potential audiences for the finding that sales associates are the main drivers of customer dissatisfaction.

-   The head office Finance and HR functions.

-   Store managers.
