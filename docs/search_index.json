I would try the following: Speaking to colleagues who have already met the new head of HR. Reading any publicly available reports, blogs etc. the new head of HR has written. Scheduling a meeting with the new head of HR. I would focus on trying to address the following questions: What does the new head of HR perceive to be the major challenges facing the organization? What are the professional interests of the new head of HR and what is their background? Has their career taken them from specialist in a specific area to a more generalist role? Why has this specific person been hired for the role of head of HR? Why now? What are the organizational drivers for needing some one with their specific skill-set, vision and approach. 2.2 Exercise 1.2: narrow your audience This exercise presents another scenario, this time you work as an analyst for a national retailer.
